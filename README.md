# Strategy Committee

The Strategy Committee is responsible for developing and supporting strategies to enable adoption and longevity of the spec. This is distinct from The Steering Committee, which is focused on the day-to-day operations and approvals for spec developments.

The Strategy Committee manages and organizes its assets in an LFE [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/17GynAWrlZ9IFXlOGhKZWOb852yhlV9dL). This includes:
