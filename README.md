# Strategy Committee

The Strategy & Technical Committee (STC) is responsible for developing and supporting strategies to enable adoption and longevity of the spec. This is a joint sub-committee of both working groups that will also support coordination + technical alignment across working groups, and approvals for spec developments.

The STC manages and organizes its assets in an LFE [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pIREYp3MmzlWcdAVM-TMZKrq3ZuEtozY?usp=sharing). This includes:
